        <h2>Welcome to dog walking volunteers Clonmel</h2>
        <p>The aim of this website is to connect dog owners in the Clonmel area with volunteers who can offer up some time to walk their pooches.</p>
        <p>The idea for this site came about after I had a discussion with an elderly neighbour. She felt guilty that she was no longer able to 
            physically keep up with her dogs in terms of energy and wished that there was some sort of service available.</p>
        <p>That got me thinking! there are surely others in the local area that could do with similar help!</p>
        <p>Doctors & nurses working long hours spring to mind. Maybe people who will be out of the Country for a 
            spell may also need the service of volunteers to walk their dog.</p>
        <p>If you are somebody willing to volunteer, then please register.</p>
        <p>If you are a dog owner who would like to avail of the generosity of volunteers, then please register.</p>
        <p>You can register your intertest here [button]</p>
