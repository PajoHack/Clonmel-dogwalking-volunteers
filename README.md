# Dog walking Volunteers

The dog walking volunteers website was created to connect Clonmel dog owners with people kind enough to offer up some time to help walk their dogs.
People who use this site can register as either a dog owner or a volunteer. We will then be able to connect people based on the details provided with the registration form.
